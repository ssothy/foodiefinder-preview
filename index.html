      <h1> An app for the forgetful foodie </h1>
      <p>
        Foodie Finder helps you save and keep track of restaurants you want to visit.
        It stores restaurants in a simple note format with checkboxes that you can use to
        check off once you've been to the restaurant you've saved to your list. For each
        restaurant you add the interface has inputs for useful information you can save for
        them to easily reference like the address and website. You can also add ratings and comments
        for when you've visited any of the restaurants for the future. Foodie Finder also helps to
        sort through restaurants by name, type, and neighborhood for easy searching.
